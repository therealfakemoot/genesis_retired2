# Objectives

## Interactive Mode

Interactive mode will be a graphic toolkit for creating and manipulating 'map data', ranging from topographical maps to biomes and weather patterns to designing cities, towns, the interiors and exteriors of buildings, and the connections/relationships both spatial and conceptual between all of the aforementioned layers.

## Library

Genesis will also expose a set of libraries for use by third party applications/plugins for creating, reading and modifying data structures created by some portion of the Genesis project. This will primarily be used to create plugins/applications that allow exporting Genesis map data to a format which can be consumed by other applications like Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, or for generating non-digital representations of the content for table-top games like Pathfinder or Dungeons and Dragons.
